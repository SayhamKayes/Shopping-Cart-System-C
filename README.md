In the ever-expanding realm of e-commerce, a shopping cart system plays a pivotal role in facilitating seamless online transactions. A shopping cart is essentially a software application that enables users to select and store items they intend to purchase from an online store. This system emulates the traditional brick-and-mortar shopping experience, allowing users to browse through a virtual catalog, add items to their cart, review their selections, and proceed to the checkout for payment.
